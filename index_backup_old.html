            </div>

            <h3>About the Super Organism</h3>
            <p>AFTER PATMOS is the moment of genesis for <a href="https://ikonberg.com/" target="_blank" class="ikonberg-link">IKONBERG</a>, a singular entity that transcends the individual: the Super Organism. This is not merely a pseudonym, but a radical synthesis of consciousness and creation. <a href="https://ikonberg.com/" target="_blank" class="ikonberg-link">IKONBERG</a> is the unified field where the inner self dissolves and reconstitutes: the architect, Peter Haubenberger; the hand, Tsuro; the infinite inner muse; the countless dream archetypes;
the persistent 'forever child'; and the complex biological vessel—a body united by vital organs and a network of 10<sup>14</sup> neurons responsible for the crystallization of a singular, shared reality.</p>

            <p><em>"Thanks for having me in your reality, welcome to ours."</em></p>

            <h3>🎨 The Genesis NFT Structure & Mechanism</h3>
            <p>The AFTER PATMOS genesis artwork is a prophetic fragment, introduced as 100 Fractional Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), currently being gifted via airdrop to foundational supporters of the <a href="https://ikonberg.com/" target="_blank" class="ikonberg-link">IKONBERG</a> collective.</p>

            <p>Once all 100 fractionalized NFTs are claimed, the original 1/1 AFTER PATMOS masterpiece will be offered via a reserved auction directly on this site. The auction will initiate with a Reserve Price and run for a 72-hour period to close.</p>

            <h4>Artistic Governance: The Collective Conductor</h4>
            <p>The 100 fractional NFT holders are designated as the Collective Conductor of <a href="https://ikonberg.com/" target="_blank" class="ikonberg-link">IKONBERG</a>. They are seen as a unified front that possesses the power to either lead or ignore the future artistic trajectory and force of the Super Organism. This ownership structure embeds a critical, decentralized governance layer into the very fabric of the art.</p>

            <h3>✨ The Attestation Mechanism: Data as Shared Ownership & Enduring Narrative</h3>
            <p>In the spirit of a true collective, ownership here is collaborative. Collectors holding a fractional After Patmos NFT are invited to step into the narrative, participating in a dynamic, ongoing creation process:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Attestation / Observation:</strong> We invite a validated subjective account—what the collector is seeing, feeling, or observing within their specific window of the artwork. This is the act of contributing individual perception to the Super Organism.</li>
                <li><strong>Metadata Permanence:</strong> This mechanism, inspired by the collector integration pioneered by <a href="https://x.com/SamSpratt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #ff8c00; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Sam Spratt</a>, ensures conceptual rigor. These attestations will be cryptographically hard-written into the individual NFT's metadata. The collector's unique insight becomes an immutable, on-chain feature of the asset, permanently linking subjective experience to the digital ledger.</li>
                <li><strong>Co-Creation Reward:</strong> Eligible participants who contribute their observation will collectively receive a significant 50% share of the proceeds from the final primary sale of the 1/1 AFTER PATMOS auction.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>This process elevates collective perception (real human data) into a valuable, proprietary asset. This data will be used to train a bespoke AI model on the emergent, collective reality of After Patmos, driving the development of future iterations and prophetic versions of the <a href="https://ikonberg.com/" target="_blank" class="ikonberg-link">IKONBERG</a> vision.</p>

            <h3>🖼️ Technical Provenance: Vector Scaling & Definitive File</h3>
            <p>The underlying artwork is a vector-based digital file, allowing for infinite scalability and maximum definition without any loss of quality—a technical commitment to archival permanence.</p>

            <p>The winner of the 1/1 auction will receive the ultimate expression of this commitment: the full, definitive vector file, exceeding 200 GB in size, enabling monumental scale printing and ensuring the highest resolution of provenance. Additionally, the winner can claim a physical high-quality print of the artwork in their preferred size.</p>

            <h3>🧠 The IKONBERG Manifesto: Art as Neurological Training</h3>
            <p><a href="https://ikonberg.com/" target="_blank" class="ikonberg-link">IKONBERG</a>'s creations are not static objects; they are instruments designed for intellectual and sensual advancement, drawing profound inspiration from philosophical concepts such as Rudolf Steiner's Theory of the Senses.</p>

            <p><strong>The constant overabundance of stimuli dominates our world. Counteract this with a targeted, healthy use of overstimulation—a deliberate friction to train and expand your neural pathways.</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Training Awareness (The Unlabeled Gaze):</strong> Our ultimate aim is to train the viewer to recognize the compulsive mental labeling of external stimuli. Through this awareness, we move closer to the pure admiration and enjoyment of abstract forms and colors, free from narrative baggage.</li>
                <li><strong>The Power of Abstraction (The Evolving Mirror):</strong> The abstract structure of our works is deliberate; it allows them to grow alongside the collector's daily life. They function as instruments and reminders of one's own progress, promoting a deeper, more sensual existence by sharpening both eyesight and mind.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Synthesis (Cooking Code):</strong> The "digitale synthesis" series comprises purely digitally created worlds, untouched by photographic or analog material. The working process, aided by automated computer processes, is an act of digital craftsmanship—akin to the deliberate, iterative process of gardening and cooking.</li>
                <li><strong>The New Collectivism (Shared Essence):</strong> We project a vision of a new, ubiquitous societal awareness where people re-engage with forgotten sensuality and dreams. We look past the illusion of radical individualism and recognize ourselves in the other, approaching a form of spirituality supported by science. As the artist suggests: <em>"Clapping needs the space, two hands, and the silence as well as the will to crash collectively."</em></li>
            </ul>
